# INSTALLATION

build.gradle uses a simple flatdir to load the server dependencies, check the file and modify if needed.

if not running in intellij, you'll need to generate the built jar and add it to the classpath before any of the server dependencies
i.e. "java -cp /path/to/customjar:/path/to/serverjars net.runelite.client.RuneLite --debug"
